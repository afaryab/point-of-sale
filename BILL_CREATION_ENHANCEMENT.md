```

#### Customer-Bill Relationship

- Customer form with all fields
- Required field: Name (marked with *)
- Optional fields: Gender, Relation Type, Relation Name, Phone, CNIC, DOB, Age
- Auto-age calculation from date of birth

**Right Half (50% width):**
- Live customer search results
- Search triggers automatically while typing name
- Search also works with phone and CNIC
- Click on result to auto-fill customer details

#### Bottom Section: Items & Preview (50% height)
**Left Area (66% width):**
- Counter and Payment Type selectors
- Quick Barcode Entry field
- Tabbed interface with icons:
  - **Products Tab**: Grid of clickable product cards

  - Customer name and phone display
  - List of added items with quantities and prices
  - Individual item remove buttons
  - Real-time total calculation
  - Create Bill and Cancel buttons

### 3. User Workflow

#### Scenario 1: New Customer
1. User types customer name (e.g., "John Doe")
2. Search shows "No customers found"
3. User fills in customer details (gender, phone, CNIC, etc.)
4. User adds items by clicking on products/services
5. Live preview shows items and calculates total
6. User clicks "Create Bill"
7. System creates new customer record
8. System creates bill linked to new customer

#### Scenario 2: Existing Customer
1. User starts typing customer name
2. Search results appear in real-time
3. User clicks on existing customer
4. All customer fields auto-fill
5. User adds items from tabs
6. User clicks "Create Bill"
7. System creates bill linked to existing customer

### 4. Technical Implementation

#### Frontend (Alpine.js)
```javascript
- billForm() component manages:
  - Customer search with debouncing (300ms)
  - Customer selection and auto-fill
  - Age calculation from DOB
  - Items array management
  - Tab switching
  - Real-time total calculation
  - Quick item addition
```

#### Backend (Laravel)

**CustomerController:**
- `search()`: AJAX endpoint for customer search
  - Searches by name, phone, or CNIC
  - Returns up to 10 results
  - Returns empty array for queries < 2 characters

**BillController:**
- `create()`: Passes customers, products, services, service providers to view
- `store()`: Enhanced validation and logic:
  - Validates customer fields
  - Creates customer if not selected
  - Associates customer with bill
  - Creates bill items
  - Returns to bill detail page

#### Routes
```php
Route::get('/customers/search', [CustomerController::class, 'search'])
    ->name('customers.search');
```

### 5. Styling & UX

#### Color Scheme
- Customer section header: Blue gradient (from-blue-500 to-blue-600)
- Bill preview header: Green gradient (from-green-500 to-green-600)
- Active tab: Blue border and text
- Hover effects: Blue highlights on clickable items

#### Responsive Design
- Grid layouts adapt to screen size
- Mobile-friendly with proper spacing
- Sticky bill preview on larger screens

#### Interactions
- Smooth transitions on all hover effects
- Visual feedback on clicks
- Real-time updates without page reload
- Error states with validation messages

### 6. Data Validation

#### Customer Fields
- Name: Required when creating bill
- Gender: Optional, enum validation
- Relation Type: Optional, enum validation
- Phone: Optional, string validation
- CNIC: Optional, unique validation
- Date of Birth: Optional, date validation
- Age: Optional, integer (0-150) validation

#### Bill Items
- At least 1 item required
- Valid item type (product, service, or plan)
- Valid item ID
- Quantity must be >= 1

### 7. Future Enhancements

#### Barcode Functionality (Placeholder)
The barcode entry field is present and ready for implementation:
```javascript
addByBarcode() {
    // To be implemented with barcode-to-product mapping
    // Will lookup product/service by barcode
    // Auto-add to bill items
}
```

#### Suggested Improvements
1. Barcode scanner integration
2. Customer image upload
3. Customer purchase history
4. Email receipt to customer
5. Print bill functionality
6. Discount and tax calculations
7. Multiple payment methods
8. Customer loyalty points
